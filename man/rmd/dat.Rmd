## Defining data assets valuation
A valuation of a data asset is an approximation of its perceived value under
reasonable constraints. It is by
no means an exact science. Definitions such as *data*, *information*, and *file*
carry different meanings in different contexts. Reasonable constraints such as
assumptions and precision have to be placed.

A data `asset` can refer to file locations or objects in memory.  

- List-like structures, specifically non-atomic classes where `is.recursive` is `TRUE`. This includes data.frames, environments and structures built on them.  
- File path: A path to directory or file where the user has at least read access.
